# Travel_Blog december 27 2022

This is my first project at Hamburg Coding School. Its a Travel Blog which can add cities visited with the date when they where visited. The Blog organizes the cities in cards on a left column and displays the details of a selected card on a right column with a mapbox container showing the city map and displaying an image of the city provided by the user. The Programm gets the current weather of the city with a fetch from open weather API and displays the weather information on the image. The Blog has a page to add new visited cities and also an "About" page with information about the traveler.
